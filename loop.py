# A list of product prices in dollars

# Loop through each price, multiply by 100, and add it to the new list
for price in dollar_prices:

# List Comprehension
dollar_prices = [1.50, 4.99, 10.00, 25.50]
# One single line replaces the 4 lines of code above
cents_prices = [int(price * 100) for price in dollar_prices]
print(cents_prices)
Output: [150, 499, 1000, 2550]
