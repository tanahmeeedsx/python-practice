# # When people talk about a "condition data type" in Python, they are referring to the Boolean (bool) data type.

# # Booleans represent the core of all computer logic. A Boolean variable can only ever hold one of two possible values: True or False.

# # We use Booleans to control the flow of our programs using conditional statements (like if, elif, and else).


# # 1. How Booleans are Created
# # Booleans are typically generated in two ways: by direct assignment or by using comparison operators.

# # A. Comparison Operators Cheat Sheet
# # When you compare two values, Python evaluates the expression and returns a Boolean (True or False).




# # General Example: Human Survey Eligibility
# # Imagine a survey script that checks if a person is legally an adult or if they qualify for a family tax credit.


# # Raw Data
# age = 34
# has_kids = True

# # 1. Evaluate conditional expressions (creates Boolean data)
# is_adult = age >= 18       # Evaluates to True
# qualifies_for_credit = (age > 30) and has_kids  # Evaluates to True

# # 2. Use the Boolean data to control program flow
# if is_adult:
#     print("Survey access granted.")
# else:
#     print("Access denied: Must be 18 or older.")




# # Here is a simple, practical example using if, elif, and else based on our human survey scenario.

# # Imagine you are building an automated system that looks at a person's age and determines their movie ticket pricing category.

# # Change this number to test different paths!
# age = 25 

# if age < 4:
#     # This runs if age is less than 4
#     print("Ticket is free for toddlers!")

# elif age <= 12:
#     # This runs if the first condition failed, but age is 12 or under
#     print("Child ticket price: $8.00")

# elif age < 65:
#     # This runs if all previous conditions failed, but age is under 65
#     print("Adult ticket price: $15.00")

# else:
#     # This runs as a fallback if absolutely everything else failed
#     print("Senior citizen ticket price: $10.00")


# Example: Determining Certificate Eligibility
pass_mark = 60
your_mark = 59

if your_mark >= pass_mark:
    print("you get a certificate")

elif your_mark > 50 and your_mark < 60:
    print("kaner pash diye gese") 

else:
    print("you don't get a certificate")
